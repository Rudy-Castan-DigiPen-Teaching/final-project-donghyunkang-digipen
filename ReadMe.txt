This prototype is for 3 points match in the volleyball game.
Center long rectangle is net and it is randomly give the ball.
Left rectangle is you(player) and right rectangle is AI(computer).

Player can use 'left arrow' to go left and 'right arrow' to go right.
If someone gets the 3 points he / she will be win.

How to get point:
If the ball hits the other's floor, you'll get a point.

Final game will be like have a main menu and also can play with friend in local.
Also, it will be more polished and add some effects.
I want to make it jump and googly eyes will be added too.
It could be more attractive than this prototype.

Thank you.
